## Implementation

### Usage in Python

To use the model in your Python project, make sure to install **coremltools** package first. Then, you can simply use the following snippet to envoke the model:

```python

```

### Usage in Swift

If you want to use the model in your Swift app, simply drag the model file into your project in **Xcode**. A wrapping class will be generated automatically, on top of which you will be able to use the model. It is as simple as:

```Swift
